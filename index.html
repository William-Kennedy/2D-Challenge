<a href="https://youtu.be/4HRwip-nT4w?si=6cSJAIEDMX82BbtA">The Sao Paulo VP, Premiere of the URDC</a>
<h2 style="color: #ffffff">Next races:</h2> <br>
<p>23/11/24 Las Vegas (Entry opens 16/11/24) <br>
   01/12/24 Qatar (Entry opens 24/11/24) <br>
   08/12/24 Abu Dhabi (Entry opens 02/12/24) <br>
  </p> 
<h2 style="color: #ffff00;">How it works</h2>
<p>You are given a cross section down the middle of an F1 car's chassis. Using pretty much any 2D paint software, design the rear/front wings, bodywork and the floor to fit.
Once that's designed, you send it to me for testing. I will find the coeffecient of lift and drag, and convert them into performance charachteristics in Ultimate Racing
2D 2. From there I will race the cars on the saturday of each real life Grand Prix weekend, posting the results and video to match alongside. Just for clarification this 
is all for fun. Not a proper engineering challenge, more of a game. Want to make your car a mini cooper? Do it. I don't mind if the grid looks like the wacky racers! 
If you want to design more than one car, that's fine if the reception isn't great!
<br><br>
As another dimension to this game/challenge, drivers will be able to be traded between teams.

<h2 style="color: #00ff00">The Rules</h2>
<p><b>1.0 General</b>
  <br>
1.1 The car must be able to form one closed section i.e there are no floating parts. Exceptions to this rule are found in sections 2 and 3. <br>
1.2 There must be no part of the car touching the bottom of the supplied image i.e the car has <i>some</i> ground clearance. <br>
1.3 There must be no part of the car touching the edges of the supplied image. <br>
  <br>
<b>2.0 Front Wing</b>
  <br>
2.1 There may be up too 2 floating sections of the front wing. (I suggest you use one though, as the cfd program I use doesn't have the greatest resolution) <br>
  <br>
<b>3.0 Rear Wing</b>
  <br>
3.1 There may be up too 2 floating sections of the rear wing. <br>
  <br>
<b>4.0 CFD Allowance</b>
4.1 Due to the fact that I have a life, I will only be able to do one simulation per race. Hopefully that should calm down the rampant development race we are already seeing. <br>

<h2 style="color #ff00ff">Why are you doing this Will?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Recently I started out on the hardest technical challenge of my life, the Mantium Challenge. And I love it! You have to design a whole F1 car to a rule book 
  over a dozen pages long. But that isn't for the faint of heart. Before that I designed/manufactured/tested what is <b>the</b> most advanced sg1603 bodykit ever.
  That's a pretty hefty claim, but the sg1603 is just a popular and cheap rc car. And I am one off 2 people to ever do it... Before that though, I was really interested
  in motorsport, particularly aerodynamics. But I hadn't learned 3D modelling. I didn't really know anything about aerodynamics. But I did play Ultimate Racing 2D 2.
  That's actually when I came up with this idea. But I never had the skills to make a website/run loads of CFD simulations. But now I do, and I want to bring this out
  to anyone to play. It's like a technically advanced game. So if you want to participate, go for it. It took me just five minutes to whip up a prototype! <br>
  Side note: If this doesn't get any attention (which I am sort of anticipating) I will most likely repurpose this website and the big ol' spreedsheet for a differant,
  less engineering, more F1 manager style game. But you never know. This might gain interest after all!

  pretty massive spreedsheet already and it will hopefully be getting better. Have any suggestions for new drivers to be added? Ask me and I will add them pretty quick.
