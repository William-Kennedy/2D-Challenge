<h2 style="color: #ffffff">Next races:</h2>
<p>08/12/24 Abu Dhabi (Entry opens 02/12/24)
  </p> 
<h2 style="color: #ffff00;">How it works</h2>
<p>You are given a cross section down the middle of an F1 car's chassis. Using pretty much any 2D paint software, design the rear/front wings, bodywork and the floor to fit.
Once that's designed, you send it to me for testing. I will find the coeffecient of lift and drag, and convert them into performance charachteristics in Ultimate Racing
2D 2. From there I will race the cars on the saturday of each real life Grand Prix weekend, posting the results and video to match alongside. Just for clarification this 
is all for fun. Not a proper engineering challenge, more of a game. Want to make your car a mini cooper? Do it. I don't mind if the grid looks like the wacky racers! 
<br><br>
As another dimension to this game/challenge, budget is taken into consideration, with race wins, penalties, damage and drivers all taking chunks out of the team's <br> 
50 million weekly budget <br>
</p>
<br>
<h2 style="color: #00ff00">The Rules</h2>
<p><b>1.0 General</b>
  <br>
1.1 The car must be able to form one closed section i.e there are no floating parts. Exceptions to this rule are found in sections 2 and 3. <br>
1.2 There must be no part of the car touching the bottom of the supplied image i.e the car has <i>some</i> ground clearance. <br>
1.3 There must be no part of the car touching the edges of the supplied image. <br>
  <br>
<b>2.0 Front Wing</b>
  <br>
2.1 There may be up too 2 floating sections of the front wing. (I suggest you use one though, as the cfd program I use doesn't have the greatest resolution) <br>
  <br>
<b>3.0 Rear Wing</b>
  <br>
3.1 There may be up too 2 floating sections of the rear wing. <br>
  <br>
<b>4.0 Max Speed</b> <br>
4.0 (Background) Due to an unclear and non-mathmateical method used previously for determining whether a car was too fast I have done some research into what drag coeffecient provides an unbalanced car. <br>
4.1 If the drag coeffecient determined by my simulation software is below 0.12 (changing to 0.15 after the Las Vegas VP) the car will be deemed unsafe. Thus the car will be set to 0.12 (0.15 in future) to try
and even the grid out. Note that the Lift Coeffecient will not be changed. <br>
<b>5.0 Budget</b> <br>
5.1 Everyone has Â£50 million a week. <br>
5.2 Any purchase messages must be started with three ###.(i.e ###I want to buy Max Verstappen) <br>
5.3 I will reply to these messages to confirm they have been logged. <br>
5.4 Drivers can be selected from the spreadsheet: sent the next message. <br>
5.5 The driver's cost will be taken off the weekly budget. <br>
5.6 A CFD simulation costs 10 million (free for the first simulation). It's the best way to get your car better. But you'll need to design a better car. <br>
5.7 An Engine upgrade also costs 10 million and only one can be bought per week. <br>
5.8 Your driver can be upgraded for 6 million (this will add 5 stat points) <br>
5.9 Leftover budget will be halved and added to next week and if you win you get 10 million next week

<h2 style="color #ff00ff">Why are you doing this Will?</h2>
  <p>Recently I started out on the hardest technical challenge of my life, the Mantium Challenge. And I love it! You have to design a whole F1 car to a rule book 
  over a dozen pages long. But that isn't for the faint of heart. Before that I designed/manufactured/tested what is <b>the</b> most advanced sg1603 bodykit ever.
  That's a pretty hefty claim, but the sg1603 is just a popular and cheap rc car. And I am one off 2 people to ever do it... Before that though, I was really interested
  in motorsport, particularly aerodynamics. But I hadn't learned 3D modelling. I didn't really know anything about aerodynamics. But I did play Ultimate Racing 2D 2.
  That's actually when I came up with this idea. But I never had the skills to make a website/run loads of CFD simulations. But now I do, and I want to bring this out
  to anyone to play. It's like a technically advanced game. So if you want to participate, go for it. It took me just five minutes to whip up a prototype! <br>
  Side note: If this doesn't get any attention (which I am sort of anticipating) I will most likely repurpose this website and the big ol' spreedsheet for a differant,
  less engineering, more F1 manager style game. But you never know. This might gain interest after all!
